# Notes
potential project name - Olin's Trees
## TODO
- thinking about two possible paths forward: handheld and drone capture
- rpi
  - update raspbian
  - learn more about not-quite-raw capture w/ rpi camera
  - system for remote capture - probably w/ GPIO and button or drone trigger
- drones
  - research interface for drone trigger
  - look into balancing gimbal for rpi
  - mounting solution for rpi/power
  - carry white balance card w/ drone?

## Supplies
- rpi
  - currently have model 1B and 2B
  - pi zero offers smaller package
  - compute module offers multiple camera inputs
- camera
  - currently have rpi camera NOIR v1
  - v2 has higher resolution
- filters for the camera
  - [recommended filters](https://publiclab.org/wiki/infragram#Filters) - Rosco #19 "Fire" red and #2007 or #74 blue
  - [$10 filter pack from public labs](https://publiclab.myshopify.com/products/infragram-diy-filter-pack)
- misc electronics
  - currently have two portable dc power supplies
  - need momentary buttons for triggering picture capture w/o drone
- drones
  - adapter for gopro gimbals to rpi camera
