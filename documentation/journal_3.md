## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore infrared photography as a medium and as a tool for scientific analysis. At its most basic level it involves building a portable camera with the raspberry pi and using it to capture infrared photographs. Further steps involve reconfiguring the camera to mount it to a drone, researching and learning about the process of turning these photographs into NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) data, and using/writing custom software to process photographs in a raw format and adjusting the white balance of the camera.

One of the challenges will be research into the process of creating NDVI data from infrared photographs (part of this is explained in the Public Labs forum post <https://publiclab.org/notes/LaPa/12-03-2015/how-do-i-set-a-costum-white-balance-of-the-noir-modulo-cam>). Another challenge will be documenting work and the design process of the camera.

Final deliverables will be in the form of:
- printed photos with a variety of filters/analysis
- a portable camera based on the raspberry pi that can be reconstructed by anyone
- documentation of the project and building of the camera
- a digital presentation in the form of a website

## Preliminary Timeline
- Week of March 26th
  - get camera working with the rpi, write basic code for capture
  - order parts from ECE stockroom
  - order rpi supplies
- Week of April 2nd
  - brainstorm subjects, talk to Bill Scully
  - research NDVI/white balance challenges
  - design portable case for camera
  - finalize code for image capture
- Week of April 9th
  - map out/take initial photos
  - build final model of camera
  - research mounting on drone
  - begin writing code for processing raw image files*
  - begin writing code for custom white balance correction*
- Week of April 16th
  - take final photos
  - mount on drone if possible
- Week of April 23rd
  - select/process photos
  - create presentation/project website
- Week of April 30th (FINALS)
