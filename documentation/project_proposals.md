## Perception Installation w/ Strobe Light
A strobe light room containing a variety of exhibits that cause the viewer to acknowledge and question their perceptual limitations.  
This is inspired by Bill Seeley's lecture and my experience playing with a fellow student's strobe light.  
It's a little hard to describe but the experience is incredibly compelling.

#### Involves
- research into the anatomy/psychology of the effects
- building/picking a room
- creating exhibits
- tackling the problem of potential epilepsy/seizures
